Predict the temperature column ‘ _tempm’ for Delhi, using Time Series Forecasting
Share your understanding of underlying data using descriptive analytics (You’re encouraged to
do data cleaning as well)
For prediction, try multiple available techniques and choose the best performing model
Does a time series model developed using deep learning techniques give more accurate
predictions?
Model must take a date as input and output the probable temperature for that day (so basically
forecast to the given date and then report the value of that date)
You are allowed to use the other accompanying features as input as well and create a multi-
variate forecasting model.
The training data is available from Jan 1996 - Nov 2016. We will use data from Dec 2016 -
April 2017 to check the model accuracy/validity.
